2. **Collaborator's screen**: I will knit the Rmarkdown file `plot-trait-evolution.Rmd` which sources all the contributed files. Knitting a Rmarkdown file means rendering the Rmarkdown code (that integrate R code and Markdown code) into a defined format, here a html file. This file generates plots and figures based on the parameters that were contributed.

3. **Collaborator's screen**: If all packages needed to run this script and to knit the file into a html page are installed, this file will generate plots and figures based on the parameters that were contributed.
